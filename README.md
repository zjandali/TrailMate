## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- **Python** (3.6 or higher) for the machine learning service
- **MongoDB** database instance
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (optional, for containerization)
- **API Keys** for third-party services:
  - **OpenWeatherMap API Key**
  - **Hiking Project API Key** (or any other trail data API)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trailmate.git
   cd trailmate/trailmate-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `trailmate-backend` directory:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
   HIKING_PROJECT_API_KEY=your_hiking_project_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the backend server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**

   ```bash
   cd ../trailmate-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `trailmate-frontend` directory:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. **Run the frontend application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Machine Learning Service Setup

1. **Navigate to the ML service directory**

   ```bash
   cd ../trailmate-ml
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the ML service**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The ML service should now be running on `http://localhost:5001`.
